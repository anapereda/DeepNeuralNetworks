# Deep Neural Networks Challenge

In this module I designed and train a machine learning model using deep neural network. The main goals was to create a model to predict if a nonprofit was going to be successful with the money awarded by the foundation Alphabet Soup. From the dataset, I decided t o leave out the EIN and Name characteristic  from the model features because they are individual characteristics that do not have an effect on the predictive outcome or target value; the target value was the ‘IS_SUCCESSFUL’ columns which is a binomial category accurately formatted for our purposes of this analysis. I first designed a single layer neural network with 70 neurons, this number was chosen because it is more than double of the number of features, and achieved a 51% accuracy. To optimize the model I decided to design a deep neural network with two hidden layers , accuracy was improved to 53%. Although accuracy was achieved, I did try optimizing by playing with some features and adding more hidden layers; however no improvement was seen. To further look for improvements I would change the activation equation to a Leaky ReLu, and also probably do an unsupervised machine learning classification model to look at trends and being able to design a better machine learning model only using the features that have a greater influence on. I would like to try using a Random Forest Classifier; this is a good fit model because we are working with a large tabular tardaste, a lot less computer power will go into the model and maybe and improve of the model as the rely activation function is not really accurately predicting any of the values.
